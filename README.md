# Investigate-a-Dataset
In this project I seek to identify the factors that are important in predicting whether or not a patient shows up for their scheduled appointments by utilizing various tools such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib. I chose the 'noshowappointments' dataset that collects information from 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil. Some of the crucial questions that I seek to analyze include:

If the gender affects patients showing up
If age affects patients showing up
If neighbourhood affects whether patients show up
If scholarship affects patients that show up
If chronic illnesses affect patients that show up.
